set -u

# Exit immediately if a pipeline, which may consist of a single simple command, a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero status.  The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a `while' or `until' keyword, part of the test in an `if' statement, part of any command executed in a `&&' or `||' list except the command following the final `&&' or `||', any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return status is being inverted with `!'.  If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while `-e' was being ignored, the shell does not exit.  A trap on `ERR', if set, is executed before the shell exits.
set -e

# If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully.
set -o pipefail
